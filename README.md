# DataVisualization_R

I used perfect leaflet package for creating maps in R programming language. You can see several types of charts have been used in this notebook. 
As we know R has great features for visualization, I made some fancy maps which even includes animations. All London maps can change dynamically when you zoom in or out. 
Here the tasks that I included in notebook:

Description
Analysing UK house price data from the Land Registry. 
The entire dataset (4 Gb)
The exercise is divided into the following tasks:
Task A:
A1. For the 33 London boroughs create a box-plot (or several box-plots) that compares house prices between the boroughs. Can you think of a better way to compare borough house prices (please demonstrate)?
A2. Could the entire dataset be used to estimate the relationship between price of flats and floor level? If yes, how would you show that relationship in a plot?
Task B:
B1. Create a GeoJSON file where each postcode is represented with a latitude, longitude value, together with minimum, maximum, mean and median house price.
B2. Open the GeoJSON file in the GIS application of your choice and colour-code the data to give an overview of areas with high, medium and low median house price. Additionally, you can visualise this information as cloropleths or use shiny and add the information as markers on a map for a more interactive and impressive result.
B3. Instead of using median price, you could have been asked to colour-code the mean house price. Would that have given a better view of the house prices across the UK? Please justify your answer.
Task C:
C1. Examine the house prices for 2015. How do these change over time? Do property prices seem to increase or decrease throughout the year?
C2. Is there a significant relationship between the price of a property and the time of year it is sold? Does this vary with type of property?
